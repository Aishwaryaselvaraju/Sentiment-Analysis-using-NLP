# Sentiment-Analysis-using-NLP# Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This project builds a **Sentiment Analysis** model to classify text data (e.g., product reviews, social media posts, etc.) into three sentiment categories: **positive**, **neutral**, and **negative**. The model uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques such as **tokenization**, **stopword removal**, **lemmatization**, and **TF-IDF** vectorization for feature extraction. It then trains machine learning models, including **Logistic Regression** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, to classify the sentiment of the text.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains text data (e.g., product reviews, tweets, social media posts) and the corresponding sentiment label. The sentiment is classified as:
- **positive**
- **neutral**
- **negative**

Example of dataset structure:

| text                               | sentiment |
|------------------------------------|-----------|
| "I love this product, it's amazing!" | positive  |
| "The movie was boring and slow."    | negative  |
| "It's an average product, okay."    | neutral   |

You can use datasets such as **IMDB movie reviews**, **Twitter sentiment data**, or **Amazon product reviews**. In this repository, you can use any dataset with text data and a sentiment label.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Tokenization**: Splits the text into individual words.
   - **Stopword Removal**: Removes common words (e.g., "the", "is") that don't contribute much to sentiment classification.
   - **Lemmatization**: Reduces words to their base form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").
   
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - The cleaned text is transformed into numerical features using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**, which captures the importance of words in the context of the document.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Two machine learning models are trained to classify the text:
     - **Logistic Regression**
     - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - These models are trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The models are evaluated using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
   - A **confusion matrix** is also generated to visualize the model's performance.

## Models Used

The following machine learning models are used in this project:

- **Logistic Regression**: A linear model that predicts the probability of a text belonging to a particular class (positive, neutral, negative).
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classifier that tries to find the optimal hyperplane to separate the data into different classes.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the models is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A table that visualizes the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `nltk`: For natural language processing tasks.
